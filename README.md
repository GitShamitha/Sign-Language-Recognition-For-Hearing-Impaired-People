# Sign-Language-Recognition-For-Hearing-Impaired-People

**Abstract**
Communication barriers continue to exist between hearing and deaf people, particularly in terms of real-time sign language communication, despite technological developments. Conventional strategies, like text-based communication and human translators, don't provide the availability, speed, and naturalness needed for productive conversation. The main intention is to create a dependable and precise technology for identifying gestures that can transform movements into written language in real-time, improving communication between hearing and deaf people. The suggested system makes use of MediaPipe for accurate hand tracking and gesture detection, and OpenCV for image and video processing. To assess intricate sign language patterns, the system makes use of cutting-edge machine learning methods including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The procedure includes gathering data, preprocessing it, extracting features, training the model, and evaluating it. The framework makes use of methods like data augmentation and adaptive learning to ensure that it remains stable under a range of illumination and environmental conditions. The precise hand landmark identification provided by MediaPipe improves the system's capacity to divide and identify motions. The models are assessed by applying performance measures like as exactness, recollection, and reliability, and F1 score, with cross-validation guaranteeing consistency. The system's the intention is to offer a user-friendly interface that makes it easier for hearing and deaf people to communicate together. The deaf and hard-of-hearing group will gain a tremendous deal from this research's dependable, automated real-time sign language interpreting system, which will also improve communication and quality of life. Through the resolution of technical issues and the guarantee of system responsiveness in practical situations, this work advances inclusivity and accessibility. TensorFlow is used for model creation across the system, while Streamlit is used to create an engaging and dynamic online application.
